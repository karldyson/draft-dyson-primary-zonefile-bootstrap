1.  Introduction

   Once a DNS zone file exists, there are standards compliant ways to
   distribute that zone to secondary servers in [RFC9432] DNS Catalog
   Zones, as well as standards compliant ways to alter the contents of
   the zone in [RFC2136] Dynamic Updates.

   However there is no standards compliant method of bootstrapping the
   presence of a new empty zone file ready for those two processes to
   work with.

   There are vendor specific methods, such as RNDC for ISC BIND, which
   can be used remotely, but which still requires you to have created
   the underlying zone file on the primary server filesystem.

   PowerDNS has a proprietary API that can be used, and other products
   likewise have mechanisms.

   However, there's no standards compliant vendor independent mechanism
   of signalling to the primary server that a new zone file is to be
   created.

   Operators of large scale DNS systems will want to be able to signal
   the creation of a new zone without wanting to be tied to a particular
   vendor's software, and without the need or overhead of engineering a
   bespoke solution with the ongoing need to support and maintain that.

   This document sets out to instigate discussion of possible solutions
   to this problem with an initial strawman.

   It may be considered that this is "nameserver configuration",
   however, it has strong parallels in this regard to the
   "configuration" on secondary servers, including such considerations
   as to which entities are allowed to notify and/or transfer the zone,
   as are conveyed to those secondary servers in [RFC9432] DNS Catalog
   Zones.  Indeed, much of the same configuration may be needed by or
   shared with the primary server for those same zones.

   The scope may of this document is confined to the initial bootstrap
   provisioning of the zone file, and broader provisioning of the base
   nameserver configuration is beyond the scope of this discussion and
   document.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document doesn't alter the conventions and definitions as
   defined in [RFC9432] DNS Catalog Zones.

3.  General Approach

   It is anticipated that the reason for desiring the ability to
   dynamically provision a zone on the primary server is because the
   operator will then manage resource records in the zone via Dynamic
   Updates [RFC2136], and will want to distribute the zones to their
   secondary servers via Catalog Zones [RFC9432].

4.  Catalog Properties

4.1.  Zonefile Bootstrap (boot property)

   When suitable configuration is activated in the implementation, and a
   new entry is added to the catalog being served by the primary, the
   primary should create the underlying zonefile with the parameters
   outlined in the boot property.

   The implementation MAY permit the following on a global, or per
   catalog basis, by way of suitable configuration parameters:

   *  The zone file is ONLY created if the zonefile does not already
      exist

   *  The zone file is NEVER created (effectively, the bootstrap
      capability is disabled for this catalog or primary server)

   *  The zone file is ALWAYS created, overwriting any existing zone
      file

4.2.  Start Of Authority (soa property)

   The soa property is used to specify the SOA that will be applied to
   the created zonefile for the member zone.

   Clearly an actual SOA record type cannot be used here, and so the
   parameters to be applied shall be constructed in a TXT record type as
   follows:

   soa.boot.$CATZ 0 IN TXT ( "mname:<mname>; rname:<rname>; "
         "refresh:<refresh>; retry:<retry>; expire:<expire>; "
         "minimum:<minimum>" )

   There MUST NOT be more than a single soa property record with the
   exception that a member zone record can be specified to override the
   default (see section x below).

   Multiple soa property records constitues a broken catalog zone, which
   MUST NOT be processed (see [RFC9432] section 5.1).

4.3.  Nameservers (ns property)

   Once again, actual NS records cannot be used, as we do not want to
   actually delegate outside of this catalog zone, and so the
   nameservers will be specified in a TXT record as follows, along with
   the asssociated IP addresses, if required.

   If the nameservers are in-bailiwick and address records are therefore
   required, suitable address records MUST be created in the zone from
   the entries specified.

   If the nameservers are in-bailiwick, and at least one address is not
   specified, this denotes a broken catalog zone, which MUST NOT be
   processed.

   The ns property can be specified multiple times, with one nameserver
   specified per entry.

   ns.boot.$CATZ 0 IN TXT ( "ns:some.name.server.; "
         "a:192.0.2.1; aaaa:2001:db8::1" )

5.  Member Zone Properties

   The default properties outlined above can be overridden on a per zone
   basis as follows.  Where per zone entries are specified in the
   catalog, they MUST be used in preference to the default properties.

   A subset MAY be specified here; for example, the SOA could be omitted
   here and just the NS records or DNSSEC parameters specified, with the
   defaults picked up for the other parameters.

   <unique-N>.zones.$CATZ 0 IN PTR example.com.
   soa.boot.<unique-N>.zones.$CATZ 0 IN TXT ( "mname:<mname>; "
         "rname:<rname>; refresh:<refresh>; retry:<retry>; "
         "expire:<expire>; minimum:<minimum>" )
   ns.boot.<unique-N>.zones.$CATZ 0 IN TXT ( "ns:some.name.server.; "
         "a:192.0.2.1; aaaa:2001:db8::1" )

6.  Name Server Behaviour

6.1.  General Behaviour

   The parameters specified in the boot property will contain hostnames,
   for example in the NS records and in the SOA; these WILL be
   replicated verbatim into the zone upon creation, and so it should be
   noted that if they would be fully qualified in a manually created
   zone file, they MUST be fully quallified in the parameter
   specification in the property.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document does not alter the security considerations already
   outlined in [RFC9432]

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add the following entries to the registry:

   Registry Name: DNS Catalog Zones Properties

Appendix A.  Catalog Zone Example

   The following is an example showing the additional properties and
   parameters as outlined in this document.

   There are defaults specified for the SOA and NS records, which would
   be used by the example.com. zone.

   The example.net. zone would utilise the default SOA record, but would
   utilise the more specific NS records.

   The A and AAAA records for the default nameservers are in-bailiwick
   of example.com, and so the records would be expected to be created in
   that zone, however, they would of course not be expected to be added
   to the example.net zone.

   catz.invalid. 0 SOA invalid. invalid. 1 3600 600 2419200 3600
   catz.invalid. 0 NS invalid.
   soa.boot.catz.invalid. 0 TXT ( "mname:ns.example.com.; "
         "rname:hostmaster.example.com.; refresh:14400; "
         "retry:900; expire:2419200; minimum:3600" )
   ns.boot.catz.invalid. 0 TXT ( "ns:ns1.example.com. a:192.0.2.1 "
         "aaaa:2001:db8::1" )
   ns.boot.catz.invalid. 0 TXT ( "ns:ns2.example.com. a:192.0.2.2 "
         "aaaa:2001:db8::2" )
   kahdkh6f.zones.catz.invalid. 0 PTR example.com.
   hajhsjha.zones.catz.invalid. 0 PTR example.net.
   ns.hajhsjha.zones.catz.invalid. 0 TXT "ns:ns.example.org"
   ns.hajhsjha.zones.catz.invalid. 0 TXT ( "ns:ns.example.net"
         "a:192.0.2.250; aaaa:2001:db8:ff::149" )

Appendix B.  Author Notes/Thoughts

   NB: To be removed by the RFC Editor prior to publication.

B.1.  Is catalog zones the right place for this?

   Much consideration has been given as to whether the primary server
   should be consuming the/a catalog zone, rather than simply serving it
   to secondary servers for consumption.

   It does feel a little bit like it muddies the waters between zone
   distribution and zone "provisioning" but:

   1.  In a catalog zone scenario, the catalog equally feels like the
       place for zone related parameters

   2.  It feels less like Dynamic Updates would be the right place for
       it

   3.  An API for _just_ zone bootstrapping feels like a big thing that
       would likely not get implemented, and would likely be a part of a
       wider implementation's general nameserver configuration and
       operations API, which is waaaaay beyond the scope of this
       document/standardisation

   TODO - add more detail explaining the above, reasoning, etc...?

B.2.  DNSSEC

   It seems that it'd be useful to signal initial policy/settings for
   DNSSEC in a standardised way also, but the primary might, or might
   not be the signer; the signer may be downstream.  But it might be
   very nice to be able to signal to the signer that it should create
   some keys, sign the zone...

B.3.  coo Property

   Are there any considerations around change of ownership that need
   mentioning or documenting here...?

B.4.  soa Property

   Consideration was given as to whether things like SOA parameters
   should be individual records, but it seemed unnecessary to break them
   out and create the additional records.

   Should we permit the property to be made up of multiple TXT records
   so long as a given parameter is not repeated?
